# HackersConfig
Configure your terminal before starting your penetration tests!

Let's assume you downloaded a new Linux and want to put the pentest tools on it. So you don't need to download them one by one, I created this bash script that automates this, so you no longer need to download the tools one by one.

# How to install?
